Proposal for Meeting Management Procedures Takk 



Agenda 


Select Secretary and Chairperson (2-5 min) 

The Secretary writes notes. The Chairperson ensures the agenda is followed, time is respected, and ideas get to flourish. 


Discussions (10 min) 

General discussion about what events are in these periods to get a better feel for the status before going deeper. 

Current week. 

Next week. 

Large upcoming events. 


Brainstorming for Next Events (15 min) - Very Important! 

After discussions, it is appropriate to use the momentum created to generate ideas and consider how to make good events better, traditional events more varied, etc. 

It is important that the chairperson is open to everything (no matter how crazy, must not be ashamed), praises suggestions, and tries to pull ideas in from the fringes. 


Examples of discussion topics included: 

How can we get everyone at Takk to attend an event where they have fun? 

How would we make the next event even bigger and more magnificent? 

Draw from personal experience: What event in your life is memorable? 

Regardless of whether it is based on real events or not (e.g., "Hunger Games", "Try not to laugh", "Wild 'n Out", etc.). 


Prioritize Tasks (5-10 min) 

Good project management relies on good prioritization. No task becomes late if prioritization is excellent (though difficult to assert regarding the quality of those tasks). Important to see and define quickly what needs to be done and what can be done. 


Important not to linger on the status: Make the choice quickly. 

Tasks can be labeled: 

"Hot" (Most important) 

"Warm" (Important) 

"Cold" (Possible) 

"Cold" can always wait, "Warm" can be reviewed, "Hot" needs to be done. 


Create Task List for Priority Tasks (15 min) 

Create a task list. Keep in mind that most tasks can surely (to some extent) be repeated. Thus, you can create a template for the process each time. 

Possible to use Planner or write notes in the meeting minutes below. 

Possible to create a Canva folder for recurring events (e.g., football, pub quiz, etc.). 


[For the first time: Decide how the agenda will be (5-10 min)] 

Do you like this agenda, or is it appropriate to change something? 

Some things might be difficult in execution at first, but definitely call on me if you want me to go over certain items with you (e.g., brainstorming). 


Set Up Event or Start on Tasks (If time, 5-10 min) 

If time allows at the end of the meeting, it is not unwise to use it to create tasks as soon as possible. Start rather than wait. 


Meeting Minutes Meeting minutes are—in reality—a more formal name for a meeting report. The main emphasis points of the meeting (ideas, problems, solutions, decisions, tasks, and questions) should collect there, but not minor details (exact words of each person or everything that comes up). 



It is important to draw the core out of each agenda item (often in the form of a question) to create a coherent emphasis point (which is not possible if the majority of the time is spent writing minor details). For example, a concise answer to... What necessary: 


Ideas 

Problems 

Solutions 

Decisions 

Tasks 

Questions ...came up? 


If the secretary is unsure of the answer to any of the following, they should always take the floor and ask the group before moving on (e.g., "What is the decision here?").  The meeting minutes are a key element in the overview for all involved regarding the development of the work. They are therefore always a priority, above other items. 



Useful tools for meeting minutes: 

OneNote (best tool, can teach). 

Planner (for project management). 

Teams (simple version for meeting notes). 

Word. 

Important: Create the minutes as you go and then save in the appropriate place. Do not linger over them. They may be imperfect with a heap of spelling and grammar errors, as long as the main emphasis points get through. 


Example of a template: 


Writing on discussions: Secretary writes down emphasis points for each chapter: 

Secretary and Chairperson 

Discussion 

Brainstorming 

Prioritization of tasks 

Task list for priority tasks 

[For the first time: Decide agenda] 

Tasks: Writes possible tasks that are created in the meeting as they happen under "Tasks". Underline: As they happen. Then divide into two parts with the group: 

All tasks (Warm, Cold) 

Priority tasks (Hot) 


To Andri, Flóki, and Pétur: 

If at any time a complication or uncertainty arises in a meeting, it can be directed to us in the form of a question or as an approval request ("Is this allowed?"). Important to send this part separately to all of us (if appropriate) immediately at the end of the meeting. 


Questions 

Requires approval 


Closing Points Regarding Procedures: 

Try to follow the agenda you choose—always. This makes you more efficient each time. 


But of course, it’s fine to be flexible at first. 

Be vigilant about time. Try acting as if the time limits are "a matter of life and death". 

Train each other to be promising chairpersons. Point out when it is appropriate to stop discussions. 

Stop yourselves if discussions have gone far beyond the agenda item (though applies variably in the brainstorming item). 

Encourage good meeting management by praising each other for good control of meetings (time management, control of meeting content, problem-solving, project management). 

Likewise, discuss if you feel you are being overlooked in meetings. 

Always write down the meeting minutes (and thereby all content) instantly. Never after the meeting (wastes time and loses important information). Meeting minutes are always a priority. 

Remember that fantastic, well-executed meetings are the key to fantastic information flow and organization—and consequently outstanding cooperation! All these procedures aim for that. 


This is also training for you in an underrated but truly important role: Fantastic meeting management.
